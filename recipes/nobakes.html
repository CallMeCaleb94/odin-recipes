    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>These Classic No-Bake Cookies only require a few simple ingredients and are incredibly easy to make. Loaded with peanut butter, oats, and cocoa powder, these cookies are perfect for an easy dessert!</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
      <li>Unsweetened Cocoa Powder</li>
      <li>Peanut Butter</li>
      <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
      <li>Quick-Cooking Oats</li>
      <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To start, line a couple of large baking sheets with parchment paper and set them aside</li>
        <li>Next, combine the sliced butter, granulated sugar, milk and cocoa powder in a large saucepan and place it over medium heat. One the butter is melted, bring the mixture to a rolling boil and allow it to boil for one minute.</li>
        <li>Now here's another important thing, set a timer for exactly 60 seconds once the mixture comes to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Once the timer goes off, remove it from the heat and stir in the peanut butter and vanilla extract until it's nice and smooth. Add the quick-cooking oats and stir them in until all of the oats are coated.</li>
        <li>Then, use a cookie scoop to scoop the mixture and drop cookies onto the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>The cookies will be very soft at first, but will continue set up more as they cool. Usually taking 20-30 minutes to full set.</li>
      </ul>

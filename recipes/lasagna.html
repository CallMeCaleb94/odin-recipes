		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This easy lasagna recipe has been in development since my 7th grade home economics class. Over the years the recipe has been changed probably over a hundred times, but in the last 5 years it has not changed a single time. Itâ€™s finally gotten to a place that it is truly the Ultimate Meat Lasagna.</p>
	  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	  <ul>
	  	<li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
	  	<li>2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
	  	<li>2 teaspons dried oregano</li>
	  	<li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
	  	<li>2 teaspoons Kosher salt</li>
	  	<li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper falkes</li>
	  	<li>6 cups marinara sauce</li>
	  	<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
	  	<li>1 box lasagna noodles (Do not boil)</li>
	  	<li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
	  	<li>1 egg</li>
	  	<li>1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
	  	<li>1/2 pound of Provolone cheese (sliced)</li>
	  	<li>1/2 pound mozzarella cheese (sliced)</li>
	  	<li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
	  <ol>
	  	<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</li>
	  	<li>In a large pot, brown the beef in one large piece until it is browned on the bottom, 2-3minutes, breaking apart the beef into slightly larger chunks.</li>
	  	<li>Cook unitl the beef is browned and add in the basil, oregano, 2 teaspons Kosher Salt, crushed red pepper flakes and fennel seeds.</li>
	  	<li>Stir until you start to smeel the fennel seeds starting to toast then drain the fat and add in the mariana sauce.</li>
	  	<li>In your ricotta container, if you hae space, add the egg and 1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt and mix well.</li>
	  	<li>Add your no boil noodles to the meat sauce ( you are not looking to cook them, just coat them in the sauce to ensure they don't get dry in the oven).</li>
	  	<li>Put the 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan ( use one with straight sides for easy assembly and for added height. If you are using a glass baking pan with curved sides it may not be large enough to fit this quanity of food).</li>
	  	<li>Add the dried no boil noodles in an even layer, for this pan it was 5 noodles per layer, four across and one broken in half lengthwise to go down the side of the pan.</li>
	  	<li>Add 1/3 the provolone slices, another 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce, 1/4 of the mozzarella, 1/4 of the parmesan and 1/3 of the ricotta in spoonfuls dotting across the pan.</li>
	  	<li>Repeat with the same noodle/cheese/meat sauce process.</li>
	  	<li>Finally, add a top layer of lasagna noodles and cover with remaining Parmesan and mozzarella. Cover with foil.</li>
	  	<li>Bake for 40 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional ten minutes to brown the cheese.</li>
	  	<li>Let cool for 20-25 minutes before serving.</li>
	  	<li>Garnish with parsley.</li>
	  </ol>

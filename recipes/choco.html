    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Full of sweet butterscotch & chocolate flavors, exactly how a chocolate chip cookie should taste! Thick and chock full of gooey chocolate with slightly crisp edges.</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups (380 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
      <li>2 sticks (227 grams) unsalted butter, at cool room temprature</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups (247 grams) lightly packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, at room temprature</li>
      <li>2 cups (340) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Farenheit. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. IN a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
      <li>In the bowl, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and eggs. Gradually beat in the flour mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
      <li>If time permits, wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigrate for at least 24 hours but no more than 72 hours. THis allows the dough to "marinate" and makes the cookies thicker, chewier, and more flavorful. LEt dough sit at room tempraturejust until it is soft enough to scoop.</li>
      <li>Divide the douch into 3-tablespoon sized balls using a large cookie scoop and drop onto prepped baking sheets.</li>
